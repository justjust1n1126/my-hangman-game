# my-hangman-game
I made this game using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I randomly decided to make it as a project for class in 7th grade as my teacher requested a "choose whatever you want" project. I had no prior coding experience, and i learnt during spring break. i decided to create  it because I literally told myself why not? I had always wanted to learn how to code and i decided to take the iniciative and begin.  And here we are.
